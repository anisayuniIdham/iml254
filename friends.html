When people says, 'trio never works' well here we are proof that they are wrong!  
My trio consists of my three closest friends whom  I've created lasting and meaningful relationships with. We met during our high school years when we were assigned to the same dorm rooms. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:50px">
After SPM, we decided to work together at Pizza Hut for about 3 months!
Over the years, we have gone through countless laughter, tears, and memories, but one thing has always remained constant - our bond. 
Despite our busy schedules and lives taking us different directions, we always find time to catch up and discuss our achievements and tribulations. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:50px">
Our friendship is truly remarkable; it has stood the test of time, distance, and changing circumstances. We have always supported each other through the good times and the bad and have become a source of great comfort and motivation for one another.
I am truly blessed to have such wonderful friends who have brought so much joy and happiness into my life. They are like family to me and have always been there when I needed them the most, and I couldn't be more grateful!

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:50px">
This is one of my high school trio, Nurhana Azifah binti Zamri. She is a dear friend of mine. She has always shown herself to be both a kind and supportive figure. 
With her sweet and outgoing personality, she brings energy and positivity to every situation. 
Plus, she has a passion for the color pink!
As the driver in our friend trio, we always looked forward to her driving skills. Not only is she a safe driver but also a good listener and a great conversationalist. 
Whenever we are with her, we never run out of things to talk about.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:50px">
She is studying diploma Human Resource at University Malaya, and we know that she is dedicated to her studies. 
We are confident that she will make a great contributor to this industry as she has always been someone who is determined and has strong leadership skills. When it comes to her style, everything she wears and carries is always in a shade of pink - and it fits her perfectly!
She has a natural ability to brighten up everyone's mood with her presence, and we are grateful to have her in our lives.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;" >
  
<font face="monospace" size="4">
<p style="text-align: justify; margin:50px">
I've been lucky enough to have known Nur Atiqah Izzati binti Shamsudin since high school, and she is one of the most passionate individuals I've ever met.
 Her energy is contagious and her love for life is truly infectious. She is currently waiting for her STPM results.
Her passion for studying and learning is commendable, and we are confident she will excel in whatever path she chooses.
 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:50px">
Aside from her educational pursuits, she is also an avid photographer, with a particular fondness for sunset photographs, and all things green - a color that represents hope and growth. 
Her passion for taking pictures, especially of the beauty of nature and the world around her, is truly inspiring.
 She has always been there for me through thick and thin, and I am proud to call her my friend. She also loves to watch anime during her free time.
Iqa is a force to be reckoned with. Her passion, determination, and love for learning and photography are awe-inspiring, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for her. 
She has been such a supportive and amazing friend, and I am grateful for the memories we've made together.

The journey of friendship is one filled with laughter, memories, and moments of happiness. When you meet someone you truly resonate with, there's a certain spark that ignites within you, and you just know that you're destined to share moments that will last a lifetime.
That was the case with my university life. During my second semester, I met a trio of individuals who truly completed me. We became close almost instantly, and it felt like we had known each other for years. Together, we created so many unforgettable memories that will forever be etched in my heart.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;margin:50px">
Even though our adventures were often filled with eccentricity and chaos, I wouldn't trade those moments for anything in the world. I think what I loved most about our friendship was that we never took ourselves too seriously. We could always count on each other to lift our spirits when we were feeling down, or to join in on our crazy shenanigans.
I am forever grateful for the special bond that we share, and I truly believe that it's a friendship that will last a lifetime. We have been through so much together, and I know that we will continue to support each other through the good times and the bad. These are the moments that I hold so dear, and I am so lucky to have such incredible friends in my life.

  <img src="image/millah.jpg" alt="millah" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 30px;" width="20%"/>
  
<font face="monospace" size="4">
<p style="text-align: justify;margin:50px">
Kamillah and I are a dynamic duo when it comes to our love of food - as well as our passion for making our friends miserable with our pranks. We're both not afraid to indulge our cravings for junky food and instant noodles in the middle of the night, and we enjoy sharing delicious meals with our loved ones - even if that means eating it out of a takeaway box!
We have similar tastes in food, but we're also a bit picky when it comes to our eating habits. We prefer taking small portions and savoring each bite, rather than filling up on empty calories or overeating. This allows us to truly appreciate the flavors and textures of each dish, and it also helps us maintain a healthy lifestyle.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;margin:50px">
But what I love most about Kamillah is her ability to listen. She's a great friend to have around when I need to vent or when I'm feeling down. She provides me with sage advice and a lending ear whenever I need it. I can always count on her to lift my spirits and remind me of why I should never give up.
So come rain or shine, we'll always be there for each other, whether it's to share a meal, play a prank or lend an ear. Kamillah's a one-of-a-kind friend who has my back no matter what, and I'm so grateful to have her in my life.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;" >
  
    
<font face="monospace" size="4">
<p style="text-align: justify;margin:50px">
Ah, Ayuni. What a character she is. At first, I thought she was shy and reserved, but I soon realized she was anything but that. 
Her love for the color white is evident in every outfit she wears and in everything she owns. And when it comes to food, she's like a vacuum - if I don't finish my plate, you better believe she'll be there to clean it up for me! 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;margin:50px">
What really struck me about Ayuni is how outgoing and funny she is. Her sense of humor is infectious, and I can't help but smile whenever she's around.
And as a listener, she's second to none - she always manages to make me feel understood and validated, even when I'm feeling my lowest. 
But her best trait by far is her loyalty - she's a friend for life, and I wouldn't trade her for anything. 
When she's feeling down or just needs a shoulder to cry on, she always listen to her 'galau' songs. I always remind her of how precious she is to me.

<p style="text-align: justify;margin:50px">
Ziyadatullah is the ultimate gentleman - clever, kind, and always willing to lend a helping hand. His charm and charisma are impossible to resist, making him the life of every party. And he loves fashion, so rest assured he'll always be the best-dressed person in the room.
But his generosity and kindness are what really set him apart. He's always the first to offer a helping hand, whether it's lending an ear or just a shoulder to cry on. He's the perfect combination of a confidant and an advisor - always ready to dish out some sensible, realistic advice, all while keeping things lighthearted and fun.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;margin:50px">
And who can resist his infectious sense of humor? He always knows how to crack a joke or make us laugh when we're feeling down. But don't let his humor fool you - he's also incredibly thoughtful and perceptive.
Ziyadatullah is the kind of friend everyone should have. He's a true gentleman in every sense of the word, and I'm so grateful to have him in my life. He's truly a rare and special person, and I can't wait to continue making memories with him by my side.
