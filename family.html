I'm grateful for every moment I get to spend with my family, and I cherish them with all my heart.

Meet my loving parents, Idham bin Ahmad and Nor Azizah binti Abdul Razak. They were united on December 25, 1997, in a beautiful ceremony that marked the beginning of a life-long partnership. 
My dad is the epitome of patience and compassion. We called him 'momo'. His love for fishing is a source of endless joy, and I once joked that I would marry a man who shares this passion so that they could enjoy it together. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:30px">
My mom is a force of generosity and kindness. We called her 'mami'. She is always there for me when I need her, and her birthday, which falls on February 29th, makes her a rare leap year baby! 
Both of my parents are amazing individuals who have shaped me into the person I am today. I am eternally grateful for their unconditional love and support, and I know that they are my biggest fans and sources of inspiration, always rooting for me and believing in my potential.

Meet my wonderful sister, Nur Izzatul Aisyah binti Idham. Words cannot begin to describe her passion, care, and talent. She brings joy to everyone she meets with her warm smile and friendly demeanor. 
Her cooking skills are incredible, and she always makes sure that our plates are filled with the most delicious treats.

This young boy has a bright future ahead of him, and I am proud to be his aunt.
I can't wait to see what more the future holds for this amazing family. I love my sister so much and am grateful to have her in my life.

Meet my wonderful sister, Silla Nur Adila binti Idham. Her name is unique and truly reflects her inner beauty. She is someone I look up to and admire for her intelligence, leadership, and strength.
While she can be intimidating when she sets her mind on something, this only highlights her determination and tenacity. I love how straightforward she can be, and we share many interests, including reading manhwa and anime.
When we were younger, we would stay up late at night chatting and watching anime or reading manhwa. It was our way of bonding and escaping the pressures of reality.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:30px">
As we grew older, the things we chatted about evolved, and we became each other's support system. We shared our hardships and our dreams, and our conversations were always meaningful and thought-provoking.
After she graduated from university with high marks, she received the prestigious Vice-Chancellor's Award. This was a proud moment for both of us, and it showed me just how talented and driven she was.
No matter what life throws at her, I know she'll always rise to the challenge, and I am honored to have her as my sister. She is truly a one-of-a-kind individual and a shining example of resilience and grace.

Meet Sirhu Zatullah bin Idham, the oldest yet kindest brother of mine. He works as an employee at MR DIY and always has a smile on his face. His enthusiasm for life and generosity towards our family are truly heart-warming.
Even though he may love anime and manhwa, his true passion lies in his hard work and dedication. His kindness knows no bounds, as he is always willing to help with any chores around the house.
One of my most memorable moments was sharing an anime-watching session with him. Together, we devoured the action-packed plot twists and exciting fight scenes, each of us on the edge of our seats. 
I could not help but feel a sense of excitement and joy as we bonded over our shared love for action-packed reads.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify; margin:30px">
Sirhu is truly a remarkable brother. His leadership skills are not only recognized by our family but by his friends at school as well. I admire his intelligence, passion, and hard work, qualities that have taken him where he is today.
I am extremely grateful to have such an amazing and supportive brother in my life. He is an inspiration to me every day, and I couldn't be prouder.

Lastly, meet my youngest brother, Aliff Muhammad Zaim bin Idham! He's the youngest member of our family, but even as he grew up, his cuteness remained intact.
I always love the moments we shared when I treat him to his favorite ice cream or ice kepal.He's a hard worker, always ready to help out with errands around the house. Despite his adorable face, he's also a strong and determined individual.
 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin:30px">
Zaim is a student at Kolej Vokasional in Johor. He is now waiting for his result for SPVM. In his free time, he likes to hit the gym with his friends, pushing himself to be the best he can be.
While he may be younger than me, he's always been an inspiration for me to see his hard work and dedication. I can't wait to see what the future holds for him! He is a wonderful young man, and I feel blessed having him in my family.
His presence alone brings so much joy to our lives, and I know he'll continue to do great things.
